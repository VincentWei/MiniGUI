## INTRODUCTION

### What's MiniGUI

MiniGUI aims to provide a fast, stable, full-featured, and cross-platform windowing and GUI support system,
        which is especially fit for embedded systems or smart IoT devices based-on Linux/uClinux, eCos,
        and other traditional RTOSes, such as RT-Thread, FreeRTOS, RTEMS, VxWorks, ThreadX, Nucleus, pSOS, uC/OS-II, OSE, and others.

This is the source tree of MiniGUI Core, which provides the windowing and graphics interfaces as well as a lot of standard controls (toolkit).

MiniGUI is released under GPLv3 and the dual-licensing applies to commercial use.
In December 1998, the initiator of FMSoft, [Vincent Wei], began to develop MiniGUI under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
In September 2002, the core developers of MiniGUI founded [FMSoft] and started the commercial marketing with the free software.
By now, FMSoft still continues to release MiniGUI as a free software project.

For the live demos, source tarballs, and cases of MiniGUI, you can refer to the following website:

<http://www.minigui.com>

### HVML App Framework on MiniGUI

MiniGUI and its components provide a lot of controls/widgets to help your develop GUI apps in C/C++ programming language.
However, alternatively, you can use the following software to develop your apps in an easy-to-use programming language [HVML].

* [HVML] is a descriptive programming language proposed and designed by [Vincent Wei].
* [PurC] is the prime interpreter of HVML written in C lauguage.
* [xGUI Pro] is a full-featured HVML renderer based on the tailored WebKit engine.

In short, the above software suite provides an Electron-like solution that can help people develop cross-platform applications using web front-end technology.
The difference is that the solution replaces JavaScript with HVML and Node.JS with PurC.
It provides an entirely new application framework that isolates the interpreter and renderer from running in separate processes, which brings several benefits.
It greatly reduces the size and resource consumption of the entire solution, improves the overall performance, promotes the interactive responsiveness,
   and provides a simpler mechanism to integrate existing C/C++ code modules.

### MiniGUI and HybridOS

[HybridOS] is another large open source project initiated by FMSoft.
It is an open source operating system designed for embedded/AIoT devices and cloud computing environment.

HybridOS provides the complete software stack and the app framework based on [HVML] for embedded systems.
You can easily develop your products which has rich functions and excellent expressiveness by using HybridOS.

In practice, MiniGUI and the software which are used to integrated with GPU constitute the graphics stack of HybridOS.

HybridOS uses MiniGUI as the underlying windowing system, and the members of
HybridOS project are now maintaining the whole graphics stack.
The following chart shows the graphics stack of HybridOS:

```
  -----------------------------------------------
 |               MiniGUI/HVML Apps               |
 |-----------------------------------------------|
 |          |         (Graphics Stack)           |
 |          |                --------------------|
 |          |               |    Mesa-HBD        |
 |          | Cairo-HBD     |  ------------------|
 |          | MiniGUI       |  | EGL for MiniGUI |
 | C++ libs | HBDDRMDrivers |  | GL, GLES, VG    |
 | C libs   | libDRM        |  | GPU drivers     |
 |-----------------------------------------------|
 |  Linux Kernel                                 |
 |            -----------------------------------|
 |           |        DRI and DRI Drivers        |
  -----------------------------------------------
```

As shown in the chart above, the HybridOS graphics stack consists of the following software:

- `libDRM` provides some user land APIs for Linux Direct Rendering Infrastructure.
- `HBDDRMDrivers` contains the drivers (user land drivers, not kernel drivers) for
   MiniGUI DRM engine. The drivers implement the basic hardware accelerated
   2D graphics operations of various GPUs for MiniGUI.
- `Mesa-HBD` is the Mesa derivative for HybridOS, while Mesa is the open source
  implementation of OpenGL and other graphics APIs, including OpenGL ES
  (versions 1, 2, 3), OpenCL, OpenMAX, and Vulkan. It contains the following
  components:
   + The implementation of OpenGL, OpenGL ES (v1, 2, 3), and other
     graphics APIs.
   + The EGL implementation for MiniGUI platform.
   + The graphics drivers for various GPUs and a software driver called `swrast`.
- `Cairo-HBD` is the Cairo derivative for HybridOS. Cairo is a 2D vector graphics
  library for Gtk. We provide support for MiniGUI backend in `hiCairo`.

## NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 5.0.x

In version 5.0.0, we introduced some exciting new features, and refactored
a lot basic modules of MiniGUI Core.

### Compositing Schema

In this version, we enhanced the MiniGUI-Processes runtime mode to support
the compositing schema. Under compositing schema, regardless a main window
is created by the server (`mginit`) or a client, it renders the content in
a separate rendering buffer, and the server composites the contents from
all visible main windows to the ultimate scan-out frame buffer according to
the z-order information.

On the contrary, the legacy schema of MiniGUI-Processes uses the same
frame buffer for all processes (and all main windows) in the system.
So the legacy schema is also called the shared frame buffer schema.

By enabling the compositing schema, MiniGUI now can provide a better
implementation for multi-process environment:

- Easy to implement advanced user interfaces with rounded corners,
  alpha blending, blurring, and so on.
- Easy to implement animations for switching among main windows.
- Better security. One client created by different user cannot
  read/write contents in/to another windows owned by other clients.

### New Main Window Types

In this version, we also enhanced the window manager of MiniGUI Core
to support some special main window types.

Before 5.0.0, you can create a topmost main window with the style
`WS_EX_TOPMOST` in order to show the main window above all normal main windows,
and if you use MiniGUI-Processes runtime mode, the server (`mginit`) will
always create global main windows, which are shown on other main windows
created by clients.

Since 5.0.0, we introduce a concept of z-order levels for main windows.
There are eight levels in MiniGUI from top to bottom:

- The tooltip level (`WS_EX_WINTYPE_TOOLTIP`).
- The system/global level (`WS_EX_WINTYPE_GLOBAL`).
- The screen lock level (`WS_EX_WINTYPE_SCREENLOCK`).
- The docker level (`WS_EX_WINTYPE_DOCKER`).
- The higher level (`WS_EX_WINTYPE_HIGHER`).
- The normal level (`WS_EX_WINTYPE_NORMAL`).
- The launcher level (`WS_EX_WINTYPE_LAUNCHER`).
- The desktop or wallpaper.

This enhancement allows us to create a special app which acts as
screen lock, docker, or launcher.

### Virtual Window

You know that we can post or send a message to other windows which
may run in another thread under MiniGUI-Threads. The MiniGUI
messaging functions such as `PostMessage()`, `SendMessage()`,
`SendNotifyMessage()`, and the window callback procedure
provide a flexible, efficient, safe, and flexible data transfer
and synchronization mechanism for your multithreaded applications.

For example, you can send or post a message to a window from a
general purpose thread which may download a file from a remote
server under MiniGUI-Threads.

But can we use the MiniGUI messaging mechanism under
MiniGUI-Processes and MiniGUI-Standalone runtime modes for
multithreading purpose? For example, we may download a file in a
general thread and inform a window when the file is ready.

Furthermore, if we want to use the MiniGUI messaging mechanism in
a general thread to handle messages from other threads, how to do this?

The virtual window provides a solution for the requirements above.
A virtual window is a special window object which does not have
a visible window area. But after you create a virtual window in
a different thread, you can use the MiniGUI messaging mechanism
to post or send messages between the current main window thread
and the new thread.

This enhancement provides a very useful facility to you in order to
develop a well-designed multithreaded application.

### Other Enhancements

We also tune or enhance the following modules of MiniGUI Core:

- Enhanced timer support. MiniGUI now manages the timers per message thread.
  Under MiniGUI-Threads runtime mode, you can set up 32 (64 on 64-bit
  architecture) timers for each GUI threads. If you enabled virtual window,
  you can also do this for each message thread.
- Support for listening a file descriptor as long as the underlying system
  has the `select()` system call for all runtime modes. Now you can call
  `RegisterListenFD()` to register a file descriptor to be listened, and
  handle `MSG_FDEVENT` in your window callback procedure to read/write
  from/to the file descriptor. Before this version, this feature only
  available for MiniGUI-Processes runtime mode.
- Support for local data of windows. You can now set or retrieve a local data
  which is bound with a string name for a window. This will give you an
  easy-to-use interface to manage various data of a window.
- Support for hardware cursors under compositing schema. MiniGUI now can
  utilize the hardware cursors if your graphics device support it.
  You can also load a cursor from a PNG file.
- Support for loading icon from a bitmap file. You can now load an icon
  from a bitmap file such as a PNG file.
- Unified the message hook functions for all runtime modes. MiniGUI now
  provides the consistent message hook functions for all runtime modes.
- Use the update regions for cumulative updating the screen. This will
  eliminate the flickers due to the frequently redrawing of controls.

Obviously, this version brings the largest improvement since MiniGUI 3.0.0.
We did our best to ensure backward compatibility of the existed APIs
so that the old applications can smoothly migrate to the new
version. However, there are still some slight changes you need to take care.
For more information, please refer to `RELEASE-NOTES.md` file:

<https://github.com/VincentWei/minigui/blob/rel-5-0/RELEASE-NOTES.md>

## NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 4.0.x

In this version, we enhanced and tuned the APIs related to text rendering,
in order to support [HybridOS Foundation Class Library].

* Since 4.0.2, MiniGUI provides support for RTEMS, RT-Thread, and FreeRTOS.
* MiniGUI now provides complete APIs for Unicode characters processing.
  These APIs conform to Unicode 12.0.
* MiniGUI also provides new APIs to lay out, shape, and render glyphs
  from complex and mixed scripts, such as Arabic, Thai, and Indic.
* We tuned and optimized MiniGUI's logical and device font interfaces to
  support the new features above.
* MiniGUI now is enhanced to support input events which may be generated
  by input devices other than standard mouse (or single-touch panel) and
  keyboard, such as multi-touch panel (gesture), joystick, tablet tool,
  table pad, and switch. In MiniGUI 4.0, we introduce `MSG_EXIN_XXX` messages
  to support the input events from devices other than standard mouse
  and keyboard. We call these messages as 'extra input messages'.
* The NEWGAL engine of `dri` to support modern DRI/DRM-driven graphics cards
  or GPUs on Linux.
* The IAL engine of `libinput` to support all modern input devices including
  mouse, keyboard, joystick, switch, multiple touch panel, gesture, tablet tool,
  and table pad on Linux.
* We introduced a Slice Memory Allocator for fast concurrent memory chunk
  allocation.
* Cleanup and tune code for GCC 7.3.

For more information, please refer to `RELEASE-NOTES.md` file:

<https://github.com/VincentWei/minigui/blob/rel-4-0/RELEASE-NOTES.md>

Because of the changes of some APIs, we recommended strongly that you
use this version for new projects.

## NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 3.2.x

We introduce some new features in MiniGUI Version 3.2.x:

  * The support for 64-bit platform. Note that some APIs have changed
    to support 64-bit platform.
  * Some enhancements and optimizations.

For more information, please refer to `RELEASE-NOTES.md` file:

<https://github.com/VincentWei/minigui/blob/rel-3-2/RELEASE-NOTES.md>

## THE RUNTIME MODES OF MINIGUI

You can configure and compile MiniGUI as one of three runtime modes:

* `MiniGUI-Threads`: A program running on MiniGUI-Threads can create
  multiple cascaded windows in different threads, and all the windows
  belong to a single process. MiniGUI-Threads is fit for some real-time
  systems on Linux/uClinux, eCos, uC/OS-II, VxWorks, pSOS, ThreadX,
  and OSE.

* `MiniGUI-Processes`: A program running on MiniGUI-Processes is
  an independent process, which can also create multiple windows.
  MiniGUI-Processes is fit for some complex embedded systems, such as
  PDAs, Thin-Clients or STBs. This mode is only useful for full-featured
  UNIX-like operating systems, like Linux.

* `MiniGUI-Standalone`: A single process version of MiniGUI. This mode
  is useful for some small systems, like uClinux or RTOSes.

The original MiniGUI (version 1.0) run in MiniGUI-Threads mode.
It is based on POSIX-compliant thread library. And this thread-based
architecture of MiniGUI is very fit for most traditional embedded
operating systems, such as eCos, uC/OS-II, and VxWorks. However,
if you use embedded Linux, the architecture like X Window will have
better stability and scalability, because of the independent memory
address space of every process.

Since version 2.0, we provides a new runtime mode called MiniGUI-Processes.
You can use MiniGUI-Processes to run more than one MiniGUI-based
program in the form of UNIX process at the same time. MiniGUI-Processes
is a full-featured multi-process version of original MiniGUI -- You
can run a program based on MiniGUI-Processes from a program called
`mginit`. Just like X Window, the former process is called a client,
and the latter the server.

Clients connect to the server via UNIX domain socket, and the server
receives and responses requests from clients. The server provides shared
resources for clients, manage window objects, and sends mouse
(or touch screen) and keyboard events to the active top-most client.
If a client exits or dies for some reasons, it will not damage other
clients and the server.


## A BRIEF BUILDING INSTRUCTION

* `mEagle`, licensed under GPL 3.0, is an embedded GIS development platform
  which addresses the needs of map browse, query, analysis, etc

## HISTORY

21 years have pasted since MiniGUI was initially created at
the end of 1998, and now it becomes much reliable and stable.
During the past years, many remarkable changes have taken place in
the MiniGUI project.

At the original, the version 0.2.xx was based on SVGALib and PThread
(LinuxThreads). Then the version 0.3.xx had many enhanced features
including Graphics Abstract Layer (GAL), Input Abstract Layer (IAL),
and the support for multiple charsets and multiple fonts.

In version 1.0.00, we designed MiniGUI-Lite, which was more fit for
some complex embedded systems, such as PDAs, Thin-Clients, or STBs.
MiniGUI-Lite made the embedded systems more stable and efficient.
The version 1.0.00 provided the native fbcon engine based on Linux
frame buffer device directly as well.

In the development of version 1.1.00, we re-wrote the GAL and GDI
interfaces, and provided some advanced video features, such as raster
operation, transparent blitting, alpha blending, and video hardware
acceleration. We also provided some important GDI functions, such as
Ellipse, Arc, Polygon, and FloodFill.

In the development of version 1.6.0, we added advanced 2D graphics
functions to MiniGUI. It provides the abstract logical pen and brush
objects, and can be used to render advanced graphics objects.

In the development of version 2.0.x, we developed MiniGUI-Processes.

In the development of version 3.0.x, we introduced Look & Feel Renderer,
BIDI text support, Non-rectangular window, double-buffer window, and
other main features.

In the development of version 4.0.x, we introduced the support for
complex writing systems (scripts), such as Arabic, Thai, and Indic.

In the development of version 5.0.x, we introduced some new and
exciting features such as compositing schema and virtual window.

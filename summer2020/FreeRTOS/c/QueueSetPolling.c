/*
 * Tests the use of queue sets.
 *
 * A receive task creates a number of queues and adds them to a queue set before
 * blocking on the queue set receive.  A transmit task and (optionally) an
 * interrupt repeatedly unblocks the receive task by sending messages to the
 * queues in a pseudo random order.  The receive task removes the messages from
 * the queues and flags an error if the received message does not match that
 * expected.  The task sends values in the range 0 to
 * queuesetINITIAL_ISR_TX_VALUE, and the ISR sends value in the range
 * queuesetINITIAL_ISR_TX_VALUE to ULONG_MAX.
